							<h3>What are the causes of a brain tumour?</h3>

							<h3> What are the common treatments of a brain tumour?</h3>
							<p>Treatment depends on the type, location and size of tumour along with the age of the patient. Some cases involve surgery to remove the tumour followed by radiation therapy, whereas some cases use x-ray or protons rays to eliminate the cancerous cells. Chemotherapy is also performed by administering oral or intravenous medicines to kill the cancerous cells.</p></div>

							<h3>Can a brain tumor relapse after treatment?</h3>
							<p>Brain tumours have a very strong chance of relapse because even after surgery, few cancer cells may remain behind. Sometimes, they cannot be completely removed by surgery, thus leaving the chance for tumours to relapse.	</p></div>
